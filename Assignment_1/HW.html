        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I grew up in Bengaluru, Karnataka, and have deep roots in this vibrant city. Both my school and college education took place in Bengaluru, and I'm currently pursuing an engineering degree here as well. My journey in the field of technology and electronics has been an exciting one. I'm particularly passionate about PCB design, 3D design, and programming languages like HTML, Java, and Python. The world of electronics has always fascinated me, and I'm driven by the potential it holds to shape our future. In my leisure time, I find solace in music, with a diverse taste that spans across genres. I'm also an active sports enthusiast, enjoying games like cricket, kabbadi, and cycling, which keep me physically active and engaged. My life in Bengaluru has been a blend of educational growth, technological exploration, and enjoyable pastimes, making me a well-rounded individual with a zest for learning and a passion for electronics and sports.</p>
